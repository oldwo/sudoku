# sudoku
Sudoku assistant in C++, Qt

My first Qt program.

Makes solving sudoku-s of any difficulty managable.
Does not solve sudoku by itself but presents helpful visual clues.

There is much opportunity to add more sophisticated analysis,
you are welcome to do so. I hope all the necessary infrastructure is there,
including convenient Qt tricks, one of each kind.

Compiles with Qt 5.8
